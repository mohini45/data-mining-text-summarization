Abstract—Frequent and severe wildﬁres have been observed
lately on a global scale. Wildﬁres not only threaten lives and
properties, but also pose negative environmental impacts that
transcend national boundaries (e.g., greenhouse gas emission
and global warming). Thus, early wildﬁre detection with timely
feedback is much needed. We propose to use the emerging beyond
ﬁfth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) satellite Internet
of Things (IoT) communication technology to enable massive
sensor deployment for wildﬁre detection. We propose wildﬁre and
carbon emission models that take into account real environmental
data including wind speed, soil wetness, and biomass, to simulate
the ﬁre spreading process and quantify the ﬁre burning areas,
carbon emissions, and economical beneﬁts of the proposed system
against the backdrop of recent California wildﬁres. We also
conduct a satellite IoT feasibility check by analyzing the satellite
link budget. Future research directions to further illustrate the
promise of the proposed system are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Global warming is a pressing global issue and a result of
excessive green house gas (GHG) emission. A major element
of GHG is carbon dioxide. There are many contributing
factors to carbon emissions, including wildﬁres. Global carbon
emissions from ﬁres for the recent years are 2.0 GtC yr−1
which is 40% of the atmospheric carbon dioxide growth rate
[1]. Frequent and intense ﬁre activities could switch forests
from carbon stocks to sources, especially during drought times,
and such extreme cases contribute to signiﬁcant carbon emis-
sion. A timely wildﬁre detection system can reduce carbon
emissions and negative environmental impacts, as well as save
lives and properties, by shifting the ﬁre regime to a short and
small one through reducing the spread of ﬁres.

Satellite-based monitoring has been used in detecting wild-
ﬁres. However, the long scan period and low resolution of
satellites limited the performance of the system [2]. Moreover,
the two-dimensional image data from satellite-sensor remote
sensing cannot present the landscape-level ecological infor-
mation such as biomass, soil wetness, and wind speed, which
results in inaccurate detection [3]. These challenges inspired
the employment of sensor-based systems [4]. Although the
sensor-based systems could report more timely and precise in-
formation, there remain issues to address, such as deployment

robustness, sensor power management, and communication
reliability and security [5].

Various types of sensor-based systems such as observation
by watchtowers and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [6]–[8]
all face some of these issues. The installation and mainte-
nance of watchtowers are costly [6], [7]. Some conventional
watchtowers required human operation which added to the
total cost of watchtowers. Therefore, Ko et al. [6] designed a
computer vision system to replace human presence in watch-
towers. Flexibility is another issue because adding or removing
watchtowers will create redundancy or insufﬁciency in the
observation coverage. Zhang et al. [7] proposed algorithms
to optimize the locations of watchtower deployment.

Using UAVs for disaster management faces two major
challenges in regard to power management and security [8].
First, UAVs are battery-powered and the recharge time could
create a lapse in communicating essential data. Second, the
observed data by UAVs might contain sensitive or private
information, and therefore the use of UAVs is typically subject
to government regulations regarding their sizes, ranges, and
maximum ﬂight heights.

There is a potential to leverage the advances of wireless
communication and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies
for geo-hazards prevention [9]. To achieve timely wildﬁre
detection and overcome the aforementioned limitations of
watchtowers and UAVs, we propose to use the emerging
beyond ﬁfth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) satel-
lite IoT communication technology to enable massive sensor
deployment in remote areas. Satellite communication has the
advantage of covering an expansive area but is traditionally a
closed-loop small ecosystem that requires dedicated, expensive
satellite communication equipment (e.g., satellite phones), and
is not available for large-scale commercial use. We propose to
use the same radio interface and the same terrestrial radio
communication technologies (i.e., B5G or 6G) with low-cost,
consumer-grade wireless equipment for satellite IoT commu-
nication, which was shown feasible in [10], for early wildﬁre
detection. The main contributions of this paper include:

• We develop a mathematical model and perform the fea-
sibility analysis of sensor-based satellite IoT for wildﬁre
monitoring and detection. We propose a wildﬁre evolution

axis direction of the ellipse. The ﬁre spreading speed up (m/s)
can be represented as

up = umax × g(Ws) × h(βroot)

(1)

where umax is a constant representing the maximum ﬁre
spreading speed which is 0.13 m/s (0.45 km/h), and g(Ws)
and h(βroot) are functions representing the dependence of up
on the wind speed (Ws) and root zone soil wetness (βroot).
The outputs of these two functions have values between 0 and
1. g(Ws) is computed by

g(Ws) = 1 − (1 − g0) exp

where βe = 0.35 is a threshold. When the soil wetness is above
this threshold, h(βroot) = 0, which leads to up = 0. The v
speed can be calculated from the ellipse length-to-breadth ratio
LB = (up + ub)/2v. LB is related to Ws and is represented
as

axes of the ellipse.

model that takes into account wind speed and soil wet-
ness. We propose a carbon emission model. We perform
a satellite IoT feasibility check by calculating the satellite
system capacity.

• We use real environmental data such as wind, soil wet-
ness, and biomass information to conduct simulations
using California as a case study. We demonstrate the
effect of sensor density on the ﬁre burning time and the
resulting carbon emissions and monetary costs. Beneﬁts
and implications of the proposed method are discussed.

II. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM

Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed system. A massive number
of geographically distributed sensors are deployed in remote
areas (e.g., forests) for ﬁre detection. The sensors are under
the geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite beam coverage.
Upon detecting a ﬁre event, the sensors send alarm signals to
the GEO satellite en route to the ﬁre monitoring center for
intervention and ﬁre extinguishing measures.

We propose mathematical models to quantitatively evaluate
the proposed system. In what follows, we ﬁrst model the wild-
ﬁre evolution. Then, we model the carbon emission according
to the burned area and the biomass within the area. Finally,
we calculate the satellite communication link budget to verify
the number of sensors that can be supported by the system.

A. Wildﬁre Model

We extend the elliptical wildﬁre model with a single ignition
point and a constant wind magnitude and direction [11], to
wildﬁre evolution that involves multiple ignition points and
varying wind magnitudes and directions as time evolves. These
are described as follows.

1) Elliptical Fire Model: The spread of ﬁre from a single
ignition point under constant wind condition can be modeled
as an ellipse, as depicted in Fig. 2(a). Ws is the wind speed;
up is the ﬁre spreading speed in the same direction of the wind
(i.e., in the major axis direction of the ellipse); ub is the ﬁre
spreading speed in the opposite direction of the wind, where
ub = 0.2up; and v is the ﬁre spreading speed in the minor

2) Fire Evolution Model: We model the ﬁre development
with changing winds as time evolves based on the elliptical
ﬁre model. Fig. 2(b) describes the proposed ﬁre evolution
model. At time t = 0, there is a single ignition point and
a single ellipse with the wind direction depicted. As time
evolves, theoretically, each point inside the elliptical area for
t = 0 could be the next ignition point for t = 1. This entails
inﬁnitely many points. For modeling tractability, we consider
only the four points at the two ends of major and minor axes
of each ellipse as the next ignition points, to approximate ﬁre
spreading. In other words, each ellipse at time t will generate
four ellipses at time t + 1. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the winds
may change magnitudes and directions, resulting in different
shapes and rotations of ellipses, as time evolves.

We approximate the ﬁre burning area covered by the many
ellipses by the area of a circle, since directly calculating the
total area of possibly overlapping ellipses is intractable. The
center of the circle for calculating the ﬁre burning area at time
t is determined by the average coordinates of the next ignition
points at time t, and the radius of the circle is determined by
the longest distance from the center to any of the ignition
points. For example, at time t = 2, there are four shaded
ellipses and 16 next ignition points, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The
center of the circle is the average coordinates of the 16 ignition
points, and the radius of the circle is the longest distance from
the center to any of the 16 ignition points. The area of the
circle, depicted by the blue dashed circle in Fig. 2(b), will be
used to approximate the ﬁre burning area at t = 2. While this
may appear to be an overestimate of area, it is a reasonable
approximation considering the fact that in reality there are
many ellipses (instead of four) initiated from many ignition
points, as mentioned previously. Note that while at t = 1 we
can calculate the ﬁre burning area exactly (since there is only
one ellipse), we still adopt the same approximation method
for consistency.

B. Carbon Emission Model

Given the burned area, and the biomass within the area,
the corresponding carbon emission can be derived. Since
the biomass varies from place to place, we use the average
biomass to calculate the amount of carbon emissions. It
is known that the underground biomass is 20% of above-
ground biomass [12], and both underground and above-ground
the total
biomass will contribute to carbon emission. Let
burned area be A (km2) and the average (above-ground)
biomass be Bavg (Mg/ha), where Mg/ha denotes megagram
(or ton) per hectare (or 104 m2). Then, the carbon emission
in the unit of ton is given by

A × 1.2Bavg × 100

area has an area of one hectare with a biomass value.

C. Satellite Link Budget Analysis

Here, we conduct a feasibility check of GEO satellite
communication supporting sensors on the earth based on the
3GPP NB-IoT non-terrestrial network (NTN) solution [13].
We assume that the sensors are uniformly distributed in the
sensing area, and the sensing area is within the satellite
beam coverage. The GEO satellite beam diameter is 1000
km. Table I summarizes the GEO satellite communication
parameters for two cases of elevation angle [13]. 10-degree
elevation angle represents the worst case of link budget due
to the largest distance between the satellite and the sensors,
whereas 90-degree elevation angle represents the best case of
link budget as the satellite is directly overhead. Other cases of
link budget fall between these two cases.

The received carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) at the satellite for

the uplink transmission can be calculated by [14]

CNR (dB) = EIRP (dBW) + G/T (dB/K)

− PLFS (dB) − PLA (dB) − PLSM (dB)
− PLS (dB) − PLP (dB)
− BW (dBHz) − k (dBW/K/Hz)

(6)

where 100 is a unit conversion factor.

We calculate the average biomass by dividing the ﬁre
burning area into several (say, N ) smaller homogeneous areas
with biomass bn, n = 1, . . . , N , and averaging them to get the
average biomass Bavg = (b1 + b2 + · · · + bN )/N for the ﬁre

where all terms are speciﬁed in Table I except the last term
which is the Boltzmann constant k = −228.6. The ﬁrst term
of (6) is the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) equal to
23 dBm. The second term of (6) is the antenna-gain-to-noise-
temperature ratio (G/T) equal to 19 dB/K. The third term of

(6) is the free space path loss (PLFS) equal to 188.14 dB when
the elevation angle is 10 degrees, which is calculated from

PLFS = 32.45 (dB) + 20 log10(d) + 20 log10(f )

(7)

where f = 1.5 GHz and d = 40581 km from Table I. The
fourth term of (6) is the atmospheric path loss (PLA) due to
gases and rain fades, taken to be 0.16 dB. The ﬁfth term of (6)
is the shadow fading margin (PLSM) due to obstacles affecting
the wave propagation, taken to be 3 dB. The sixth term of (6)
is the scintillation loss (PLS) caused by the local variation
of the ionospheric electron density, taken to be 2.2 dB. The
seventh term of (6) is the polarization loss (PLP) caused by
the polarization mismatch in antennas, taken to be 3 dB. The
eighth term of (6) is the channel bandwidth (BW) which is
3.75 kHz. Summing up these terms gives CNR = 8.3714
dB for the worst case (10-degree elevation angle). This CNR
value, according to the transport block size (TBS) table in the
3GPP standard [15], allows the sensors to transmit 144 bits per
resource unit for uplink single tone (subcarrier) transmission.
A resource unit is 32 ms in time and 3.75 kHz in frequency.
Since the total available system bandwidth is 180 kHz, the
peak data rate (or throughput) is 144 × (180/3.75/32) bits/ms
or 216 kbps for the worst case (10-degree elevation angle).

We consider two typical cases of wildﬁre sensing based
on the sensor trafﬁc model in [16]: periodic report and ﬁre-
event-triggered report. For the ﬁrst case, the sensor report rate
is twice per day and the sensing data size per connection
is 50 bytes, which leads to 0.0093 bps under the assump-
tion of uniform trafﬁc distribution. For the second case, the
sensor report rate is once per minute with the same data
size, which leads to 6.6667 bps. The supportable numbers
of sensors operating in the ﬁrst and second cases can be
calculated as 216 (kbps)/0.0093 (bps) = 2.32 × 107 and
216 (kbps)/6.6667 (bps) = 3.24 × 104, respectively. Consid-
ering deploying one sensor per acre, or about 247 sensors per
km2, the supportable number of sensors for periodic report
can cover most of the forest area in the U.S. [17]. On the
other hand, since a ﬁre event will trigger only sensors nearby
at a time as ﬁre propagates, a capacity to support 3.24 × 104
sensors for simultaneous event-triggered report is sufﬁcient
for practical use. Clearly, increasing the system bandwidth
(which incurs additional operational cost) will increase the
link budget and the supportable number of sensors for both
cases of wildﬁre sensing.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS

A. Simulation Setup: California Wildﬁres

We consider California wildﬁres with fundamental historical
wildﬁre data as a case study for our proposed model. His-
torically, California has the highest number of wildﬁres and
burned areas among all states in the U.S. [18], motivating a
meaningful case study. The latitude and longitude of California
are 32◦ 32′ N to 42◦ N and 114◦ 8′ W to 124◦ 26′ W,
respectively. Since 1◦ of latitude equals approximately 111 km,
California spans about 1110 km vertically. Since the distance

between longitudes varies depending on the latitude, California
spans about 1012 km at 32◦ N latitude and 902 km at 42◦
N latitude horizontally. For simplicity, we approximate the
geographic area of California by a 1000 × 1100 km2 area,
as illustrated in Fig. 4, with grid cells corresponding to the
environmental data described next.

p

10 + v2
u2

Table II presents the environmental data of California in
2020 from [19]. There are four variables. u10 is the 10-
meter U-wind component and v10 is the 10-meter V-wind
component. The wind speed Ws in our wildﬁre model can
be calculated directly from Ws =
10, and the wind
direction, represented by the angle θ with the horizontal
axis, can be calculated as θ = arctan(v10/u10). Swvl1 is
volumetric soil water in the unit of %, given by the volume
of water (m3) divided by the volume of soil (m3), which
corresponds to βroot in (1). These three variables are each
three-dimensional corresponding to longitude, latitude, and
time. Speciﬁcally, the 1000×1100 km2 area depicted in Fig. 4
is divided into 111 × 101 grid cells, and the time is in the unit
of hours for the entire year of 2020, given by 366 (day) ×
24 (hr/day) = 8784 (hr). The last variable is Biomass which
is the amount of the above-ground live biomass in the unit
of Mg/ha. The value of this variable is used to calculate the
average biomass in our model in Sec. II-B to get the carbon
emission. Biomass does not vary from time to time in our
dataset but changes from location to location.

We compare our simulation results with the historical wild-
ﬁre data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection (CAL FIRE) database [20]. The database records
the incident created time, incident extinguished time, incident
coordination, and incident burned area in acre for all 255
California wildﬁres in the entire year of 2020. We set the
ignition point and starting time of each ﬁre outbreak in
our simulation according to these 255 wildﬁres for a fair
annual comparison with the historical data. The sensors are
randomly deployed (uniformly distributed) in the approximate
geographic area of California.

B. Results and Discussion

1) Fire Burning Time/Area vs. the Number of Sensors: We
ﬁrst examine the effect of the number of sensors on the ﬁre
burning time and area. Fig. 5(a) shows the burned hours vs.
the number of sensors result. For simplicity and to focus our
discussion on the contribution of the number of sensors, we
assume that the ﬁre is extinguished as soon as the ﬁre spread-

ing reaches any of the sensors. As can be seen, deploying more
sensors reduces the burned hours since the ﬁre could be more
timely detected. The number of sensors ranges from 105 to
106, where 106 sensors deployed in the 1000 × 1100 km2 area
of California amounts to approximately one sensor per km2.
The burned time when 105 and 106 sensors are deployed is
594.21 hours and 178.77 hours, respectively. In comparison,
the historical annual burned time, calculated by summing the
burning time (the duration between incident created time and
incident extinguished time) of all California wildﬁres in 2020
in the CAL FIRE database, is 36716.25 hours.

Fig. 5(b) shows the burned areas vs. the number of sensors
result. The burned areas are 1420.11 km2 and 308.35 km2
when 105 and 106 sensors are deployed, respectively. In
comparison, the annual burned area derived from the CAL
FIRE database is 10202.04 km2.

2) Carbon Emission/Price vs. the Number of Sensors: We
calculate the carbon emission based on the carbon emission
model in (5). Fig. 5(c) shows the result. The amounts of carbon
emission are 5.82 × 106 ton and 1.17 × 106 ton when 105 and
106 sensors are deployed, respectively. According to [21], we
assume per ton of carbon is equal to 20 USD. The carbon

price is shown in Fig. 5(d), which is 116.4 million USD with
105 sensors and 23.4 million USD with 106 sensors.

In comparison, the annual carbon emission from the 2020
California wildﬁres can be calculated as 10202.04 × (1.2 ×
46.6237) × 100 = 5.71 × 107 ton based on (5), where we have
adopted the average biomass value of the entire California,
46.6237 Mg/ha. This amounts to a carbon price of 1.14 billion
USD.

3) Savings vs. the Number of Sensors: The annual saving
yielded by using our proposed sensor-based system is the
monetary difference between the 1.14 billion USD cost and
the carbon price for the proposed method shown in Fig. 5(d)
plus the sensor costs. For example, assuming the sensor cost of
100 USD per sensor, the saving is 1.14 × 109 − (116.4 × 106+
105 × 100) = 1.01 × 109 USD, or 1.01 billion USD, when 105
sensors are deployed. The savings result is shown in Fig. 5(e)
for four different sensor costs. As can be seen, the proposed
sensor-based system can potentially lead to signiﬁcant annual
savings by detecting wildﬁres early.

C. Further Discussion and Future Directions

The results presented have shown the promise of the pro-
posed system. Further studies in the following directions can

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be done to enhance the completeness and generality of the
proposed system:

• The current study considers an ideal situation where ﬁre
is contained immediately upon detection of ﬁre by one
or more sensors. The time and cost associated with the
follow-up ﬁre extinguishing measures should be taken
into account to provide a more well-rounded view of the
total savings achieved by the proposed method.

• The current study considers a simple sensor placement
model (i.e., uniform distribution). In practice, the terrain
(land, sea, lake, etc.), population density (urban/suburban
areas, etc.), and heterogeneous characteristics and vege-
tation of the land coverage area may be considered for a
more intelligent and efﬁcient placement of sensors. For
example, more sensors should be deployed in high-risk,
high-ﬂammability areas such as forests. This considera-
tion can be further coupled with an analysis of the critical
ﬁre time and area beyond which a ﬁre would be difﬁcult
to control, so as to identify the required number of sensors
in speciﬁc areas.

• The current study could further take into account different
causes of ﬁre, especially, natural causes of ﬁres (e.g.,
lightning) and human-caused ﬁres, which may demand
different sensor types and data trafﬁc models.

• A proof-of-concept ﬁeld trial can be conducted to verify
the integration and testing of wildﬁre detection sensors
and NB-IoT NTNs.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have proposed a sensor-based satellite
IoT system for wildﬁre detection. We quantitatively investi-
gated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst proposed a wildﬁre model with multiple
ignition points and varying wind magnitudes and directions,
and a method to approximate the ﬁre burning area. We then
proposed a carbon emission model based on real biomass
information, as well as conducted a satellite link budget
analysis. Simulation results based on real environmental data
of California in 2020 demonstrated that deploying as few as
one sensor per km2 could reduce the annual carbon emission
by more than ten times, and deploying our system could yield
signiﬁcant annual savings of billions of USD due to early ﬁre
containment. Pointers on further research based on this pilot
study were outlined.
